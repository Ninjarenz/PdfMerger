# PDF Merger

This is a simple Python script that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for merging multiple PDF files into a single PDF document. It's built using Tkinter for the UI and relies on the `pypdf` (or `PyPDF2` as a fallback) library for PDF manipulation.

## Features

*   Add multiple PDF files to a list.
*   Reorder PDF files before merging.
*   Remove selected PDF files from the list.
*   Merge all selected PDF files into one output file.
*   Simple and intuitive Tkinter-based user interface.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt and install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install pypdf
    ```

    *(Optional: If `pypdf` causes issues, `PyPDF2` can be used as a fallback, but `pypdf` is recommended.)*

## How to Use

1.  **Run the Application:**
    Navigate to the directory containing `Main.py` in your terminal or command prompt and run:

    ```bash
    python Main.py
    ```

2.  **Add PDF Files:**
    *   Click the "Hinzuf체gen" (Add) button.
    *   Select one or more PDF files from your computer. These will appear in the list on the left.

3.  **Manage Files (Optional):**
    *   **Remove:** Select one or more files in the list and click "Entfernen" (Remove) to remove them.
    *   **Reorder:** Select a file and use the "Nach oben" (Move Up) or "Nach unten" (Move Down) buttons to change its position in the merge order.

4.  **Choose Output Location (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   Click the "Als... (Ziel w채hlen)" (Save As... (Choose Target)) button to specify the name and location for your merged PDF file. If you don't do this, you will be prompted to choose a location when you click "Zusammenf체hren".

5.  **Merge PDFs:**
    *   Click the "Zusammenf체hren (Merge)" button.
    *   If you haven't already specified an output file, a dialog will appear asking you to choose a save location and filename for the merged PDF.
    *   The application will merge the PDFs in the order they appear in the list and save the result to the specified location.

6.  **Clear List:**
    *   Click "Liste leeren" (Clear List) to remove all files from the current list.
